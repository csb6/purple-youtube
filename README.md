# BirdTube

BirdTube is a plugin for [Pidgin 3](https://pidgin.im/) that makes it possible to connect, read,
and post messages in YouTube live chats from within Pidgin.

This is an unofficial plugin not affiliated with or endorsed by either Pidgin or YouTube.

**Note**: Pidgin 3 and this plugin are alpha software and are not currently meant for non-technical users.

## Dependencies

- [GObject](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/)
- [GLib](https://docs.gtk.org/glib/)
- [Libsoup](https://libsoup.gnome.org/libsoup-3.0/)
- Purple 3 (Pidgin is a graphical frontend for this library)
- [Librest](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librest) (will be automatically cloned as a subproject)
- [Peel](https://gitlab.gnome.org/bugaevc/peel) (will be automatically cloned as a subproject)

## Building

There are two ways to build the plugin: Meson or Flatpak. Both require you to first clone this repository.

Flatpak is the easiest because it builds the plugin within a sandbox and integrates well with Pidgin 3's
use of Flatpak

### Flatpak

From the root directory of this repository, run:

```
flatpak run org.flatpak.Builder --user --force-clean --sandbox --install-deps-from=flathub build-flatpak --install im.pidgin.Pidgin3.Plugin.BirdTube.yml
```

This will build the BirdTube plugin and install it onto your system in a place where Pidgin 3 can find it,
assuming Pidgin3 is also built using Flatpak. It will also install all dependencies.

### Meson

From the root directory of this repository run:

```
meson setup build
ninja -C build
```

This locally builds the plugin and a demo program in a local directory named `build`. Note that it expects you to have installed
all dependencies beforehand.
